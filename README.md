# Used Car Price Prediction (Regression)

This project builds a complete machine learning regression workflow to predict used car prices in USD (`priceUSD`) from listing attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, engine volume, transmission, drivetrain, and segment.

The repository follows an end-to-end pipeline:

EDA -> data cleaning -> feature engineering -> preprocessing -> model comparison -> final training -> evaluation.

## Dataset

Input dataset: `cars.csv`  
Target variable: `priceUSD`

Main raw columns include:

- `make`, `model`, `year`, `condition`
- `mileage(kilometers)`, `fuel_type`, `volume(cm3)`
- `color`, `transmission`, `drive_unit`, `segment`

## Implemented Pipeline

1. Data Cleaning (`src/data_cleaning.py`)
- Renames problematic column names (`mileage(kilometers)` -> `mileage_km`, `volume(cm3)` -> `engine_volume_cm3`)
- Normalizes categorical text values
- Converts relevant columns to numeric
- Removes duplicates and invalid rows (year, non-positive prices, negative mileage)
- Applies quantile-based outlier filtering for price and mileage
- Handles missing values in key fields

2. Feature Engineering (`src/feature_engineering.py`)
- `car_age`
- `mileage_per_year`
- `engine_volume_liters`
- `is_newer_car`
- `is_high_mileage`
- `brand_model`

3. Preprocessing (`src/data_preprocessing.py`)
- Numeric pipeline: imputation + scaling
- Categorical pipeline: imputation + one-hot encoding
- Unified transformer through `ColumnTransformer`

4. Model Comparison (`src/model_comparison.py`)
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

5. Final Training (`src/model_training.py`)
- Trains selected model (default: `random_forest`)
- Saves pipeline + model to `models/car_price_model.joblib`
- Saves training metrics and sample predictions

6. Evaluation (`src/model_evaluation.py`)
- Evaluates the saved model on the test split
- Reports MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R2
- Exports real vs predicted examples with error values

## Installation

Use Python 3.11+ (tested in a virtual environment).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How To Run

Run from the project root:

```bash
python -m src.model_comparison
python -m src.model_training --model random_forest
python -m src.model_evaluation
```

## Evaluation Metrics

The project reports:

- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- R2 (coefficient of determination)

Interpretation example: if `MAE = 1200`, the model prediction is off by about 1200 USD on average.

## Current Results (Latest Run)

Final selected model: `random_forest`

Test-set metrics:

- MAE: `958.57` USD
- MSE: `2,790,035.68`
- RMSE: `1,670.34` USD
- R2: `0.9217`

Model comparison on the same split:

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R2 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| random_forest | 958.57 | 1670.34 | 0.9217 |
| decision_tree | 1145.90 | 1984.06 | 0.8896 |
| gradient_boosting | 1314.29 | 2041.63 | 0.8831 |
| linear_regression | 1623.32 | 2469.63 | 0.8289 |
| ridge | 1625.21 | 2473.09 | 0.8285 |

Result takeaway: `random_forest` achieved the best overall performance (lowest MAE/RMSE and highest R2), so it is kept as the final model in `models/car_price_model.joblib`.

## Why Random Forest Was Selected

Random Forest was selected as the final model because it achieved the lowest MAE and RMSE and the highest R2 score compared to the other tested models.

The most important metric for this task is MAE because it is easy to interpret in business terms. In this project, the final MAE is about 958.57 USD, which means that the model is wrong by about 959 USD on average.

## Output Artifacts

- Trained model: `models/car_price_model.joblib`
- Model comparison: `reports/model_comparison.csv`
- Training metrics: `reports/training_metrics.json`
- Evaluation metrics: `reports/evaluation_metrics.json`
- Prediction examples: `reports/sample_predictions.csv`, `reports/evaluation_examples.csv`

## Reproducibility Notes

- The scripts use a fixed `random_state=42` for consistent splits and model behavior.
- Raw data remains in `data/cars.csv`; intermediate cleaned and engineered files are generated automatically.
- Prefer module execution (`python -m src...`) to ensure package imports resolve correctly.

## Submission Checklist

- Public GitHub repository
- All required scripts and notebook included
- Saved final model (`.joblib`)
- Clear README with run instructions
- Re-runnable project from scratch on another machine
